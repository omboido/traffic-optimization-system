# Research Findings on Traffic Optimization Algorithms

## NP-Complete Nature of Traffic Light Optimization

Traffic signal timing optimization is a complex mathematical program that has been proven to be NP-complete in general. This means that finding an optimal solution in polynomial time is highly unlikely, and heuristic or approximation algorithms are often employed.

- **Green Light Optimal Velocity (GLOV) Problem:** The GLOV problem, particularly with binary speed choices, has been shown to be NP-complete. This problem aims to optimize vehicle speeds to pass through traffic lights without stopping.

## Optimization Approaches

Various approaches have been explored to tackle the complexity of traffic light optimization:

- **Genetic Algorithms (GA):** These algorithms are inspired by natural selection and can be used to find near-optimal solutions for complex optimization problems. They have been applied to minimize congestion and maximize traffic flow by optimizing traffic light timing.

- **Gradient Descent:** This iterative optimization algorithm can be used to find the minimum of a function. It has been investigated for its performance in traffic signal setting problems.

- **Quantum Annealing:** This is a metaheuristic for finding the global minimum of a function over a given set of candidate solutions, by a process using quantum fluctuations. It has been explored for globally controlling traffic signals.

- **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL):** Algorithms like MPLight, based on reinforcement learning, are being developed to control large numbers of traffic lights in real-time, aiming to optimize traffic flow.

- **Multi-agent Systems:** These systems involve multiple intelligent agents interacting to achieve a common goal, such as optimizing traffic flow in a network.

## Key Objectives in Traffic Optimization

Common objectives in traffic light optimization include:

- **Minimizing Average Velocity:** This is the primary objective stated in the user's request, which aims to keep vehicles moving as smoothly as possible.

- **Minimizing Car Stop Rate:** Reducing the number of times vehicles have to stop at traffic lights contributes to smoother traffic flow and reduced fuel consumption.

- **Minimizing Waiting Times and Queue Lengths:** These are common metrics used to evaluate the efficiency of traffic signal control.
